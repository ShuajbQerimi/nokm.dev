                                As a Requirements Analyst in the development of the Horeca app, my role was to gather requirements from stakeholders and translate them into clear and concise specifications for the development team. Horeca is a purchasing app designed for businesses, particularly restaurants and bars, which streamlines their procurement process and saves them time and effort. The app is connected to the company's existing base program through an API, enabling seamless communication of pricing, product information, and orders. My role also included serving as a liaison between the development team and stakeholders to ensure that everyone was on the same page and that the final product met the requirements and expectations. The API integration ensures that businesses have access to real-time information and can make purchases quickly and easily, improving their overall purchasing experience.
