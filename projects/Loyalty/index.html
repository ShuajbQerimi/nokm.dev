                                As a Requirements Analyst in the development of the VivaFresh Loyalty app, I was tasked with ensuring that the app met the needs and expectations of both the customers and the company. The VivaFresh Loyalty app is designed to reward and recognize the loyalty of VivaFresh Store customers with exclusive discounts and offers. My role involved gathering requirements from stakeholders, and working closely with the development team to ensure that the app was user-friendly and provided a smooth experience for customers. Through my efforts, the VivaFresh Loyalty app was successfully launched, providing customers with a convenient way to take advantage of the discounts and rewards offered by the store, and making their shopping experience even more personalized.
